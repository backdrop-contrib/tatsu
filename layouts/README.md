TO ACCESS THIS LAYOUT
=====================

You must move the directory: /tatsu/layouts/tatsu_hero
to:                          /layouts

It will be:                  /layouts/tatsu_hero

Under normal circumstances, layouts are seperate from the theme. We have
included this layout in this theme, because it contains specific regions that
we have provided color support through this theme. 

The layout will work with any theme, but the color module support is only available 
in this theme. We may spin this layout off into it's own project at a later date.

PURPOSE
=======

This layout provides multiple hero regions. This is useful, because a site editor
can set the background color for each hero region using the color modules settings
in this theme.
