# Tatsu
A flexible sub theme of BASIS that allows a site editor or manager to make
maximum color/visual customizations through the user interface. 

We think that there is demand for this kind of theme in the contrib space 
and welcome both feature and design suggestions. Let's make this a community
project. 

Tatsu currently includes Bootstrap css and js files. 

NOTE: We are still early in development and will try to keep things as stabile
as possible, however be prepared for significant changes. 

We found the name Tatsu on a list of good names for Dragons and later 
learned that it is also the name of a roller coaster in California, USA.
