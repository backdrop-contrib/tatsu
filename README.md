# Tatsu
A flexible theme built on top of basis

The purpose of this theme is to create a simple and flexible 
theme in the contrib space (based on Basis) in ways that make it easier for 
users to modify an out of the box theme through the UI. 

We think that there is demand for this kind of theme in the contrib space 
and welcome both feature and design suggestions.

We found the name Tatsu on a list of good names for Dragons and later learned that it is also the name of a roller coaster in California, USA.
