; Backdrop CMS .info files allow themers to easily specify some of the static
; properties of your theme. Properties such as its name, stylesheets,
; javascripts, and block regions.

; The name, description and screenshot used for this theme on the Appearance
; page at admin/appearance.

screenshot  = screenshot.png
name        = Tatsu Sub-theme Starter Kit
description = Read the included README.txt on how to create a theme with Tatsu.

; This theme is compatible with Backdrop CMS core. And it is a sub-theme of Tatsu which is also a sub-theme of Basis.

backdrop    = 1.x
base theme  = Tatsu


; This section controls the CSS files for your theme. There are 3 different
; things you can do with a "stylesheets" line:
; - Add a new stylesheet for your theme.
; - Override a module's stylesheet. If the stylesheet you are adding uses the
;   same filename as a stylesheet from a Drupal core or contrib module, your CSS
;   file will be used instead of the module's file.
; - Remove a module's stylesheet. If you specify the name of a Drupal core or
;   contrib module's stylesheets, Drupal will remove that stylesheet if you do
;   NOT include a file with that name with your theme.
;
; stylesheets[MEDIA][] = FILE
;
; The "FILE" is the name of the stylesheet to add/override/remove.
; The "MEDIA" in the first set of brackets is a media type or a media query.
; Typical CSS media types include "all", "screen", "print", and "handheld". A
; typical media query is "screen and (max-width: 320px)".
;
; CSS2.1 media types: http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/media.html#media-types
; CSS3 media queries: http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/

; First we remove any Drupal styling that Zen provides as components.
stylesheets[all][] = system.base.css
stylesheets[all][] = system.menus.css
stylesheets[all][] = system.messages.css
stylesheets[all][] = system.theme.css
stylesheets[all][] = comment.css
stylesheets[all][] = node.css

; Then we add our own stylesheet.

; If you wish to use conditional stylesheets, you should install the
; conditional stylesheets module: https://drupal.org/project/conditional_styles
;
;stylesheets-conditional[lte IE 8][all][] = css/ie8.css
